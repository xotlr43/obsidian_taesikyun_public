reminds me of Al Hashimi's Kakaya(Malay-Cambodi co-distillation)

RPP's Tiger King 3

Somehow this one reminds me of Al Hashimi's Kakaya, which was a co-dillation of Malay and Cambodi.

TK3 has that jackfruit, banana notes I smelt in Kakaya.

  

but on top of that I get this quite specific "Tiger King" lineage smell.

what is the smell of Tiger King lineage?

I'd describe the smell of this lineage as honeycomb and ant-bitten sweetness.

  

compared to previous installments, I feel TK3 leans more toward green, fruity direction.

there are pleasant raspberri-ness and that I associates with ant-bitten agarwoods.

  

as the oil settles, it gives off cola-like fizzy freshness. some might say it's minty.

over time, the oil become sweeter and sweeter untill it fades away completly.

  

like other Tiger Kings, this one has a quite strong projection and longevity.

  

I don't feel immense joy from this caliber of oil anymore because JK ruined my pallet with too much of goodness but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy this oil greatly.
