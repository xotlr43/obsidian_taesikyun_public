1918 Six Mile Dimapur Nagaland by Rising Phoenix Perfumery

Whether this oil is really about 100 years old, I cannot confirm. but after having my nose on it, I was compelled to believe that because I was taken aback by the wide range of scent spectrum and the strong regional characteristics this oil presents.

In my opinion, aging does not always improve oud oils. in some cases, oils lose their vibrancy. however, in this oil, I could still get subtle nuances that I can get from gently heated Hindi oud on an electric heater.

The opening of this oil reminded me more of Manipur rather than Nagaland, which often makes me think of mushrooms, wood, and earthy shou pu-erh. additionally, there's also some dark chocolate, ripe plum, and licorice. shortly after the application it turns into intensely sweet apricot, red berries, and hay. A few hours after the application, I felt a boozy bourbon whiskey note.

Red berry is the note that I think is one of the most distinctive regional characteristics of Nagaland Oud, and it is strongly felt in this oil, with additional aery qualities that I cannot put into words. these nuances are the main star of the whole show.

It does have a bit of a funk to it, so it is possible that some people may find it a little difficult. 

Notes: mushroom, wood, hay, shou pu-erh, dark chocolate, plum, licorice, apricot, red berries, bourbon whiskey
