IFRA actually protects consumers from a real threat, or are these restrictions due to other reasons?
for example, you can buy shrimps or peanuts in a store, although it is known that they can cause serious allergies and even death. Nobody removes them from the regiments. Not to mention alcohol and cigarettes

> IFRA is actually trying to protect perfumers from draconian, heavy-handed allergen laws that have been proposed by governments; their method of accomplishing this is to demonstrate that the industry can act responsibly with respect to known allergens without utterly gutting perfumery as we know it. It could fail in its mission and instead whole categories of materials could be outright banned..Groups actively advocating for fragrance-free public spaces and work environments would receive the thing they finally need to pass laws: proof that fragrance is created negligently and without regard for allergenic content. IFRA is probably not what you think

 > One of IFRA's roles is to prevent governments from being harangued by intensive lobbying into banning all perfume, by doing the research into what actually needs regulating. 
 > When you read some of the complete tripe proposed by pressure groups, and understand IFRA and RIFM's roles in countering the madness with science, that's when you realise the battle they have daily to prevent not just the EU, but the FDA, Japanese and Korean regulators and all kinds of over ambitious rule makers from crushing perfumery to bits.

 > If fragrance allergies worked in the same way as food allergies then you and others would be correct in their suggestions. But they don’t work in that way, and it’s not comparable to a peanut allergy at all. Granted, some portion of people are born with sensitivities to particular allergens. But the majority, as it happens, acquire this condition through overexposure to these allergens in a multi-step process. Even if you have no history of sensitivity, sensitisers can essentially "cause" you to start having allergies to that material, even in very low concentrations. Consider this:
 > 1. Let's suppose that person A has latent susceptibility to an allergy to substance B.
 > 2. Person A comes into contact with a large quantity of B, which is enough to cause immunological effects which make even small amounts of B sufficient for rashes/burning/etc.
 > Before 2, person A has no awareness that they are susceptible, and no warning would be heeded, because they would not know to avoid the product. If you are reading this, you may also have the potential to become sensitised to particular materials. In this way, the label would be completely ineffectual - A would get the allergy, and would then be unable to use a lot of fragranced goods. So a label is utterly meaningless, because with unsafe levels of some materials, a decent chunk of people actually get new allergies.
 > It would be a bit like having a food with the warning "May contain substances which we have added knowingly that will give a random 5% of you an illness - one which won't present itself straight away but will make you unable to enjoy this and similar products in the future." If you really think that's fine, this debate becomes not a scientific one but a political one, and you ought to be against seatbelts, asbestos bans and food regulation in general. I, and the vast majority of others, are happy for products in general to be regulated so that the same products can enjoy continued use.

 >I have mixed feelings on this one…
 >Generally speaking, I think guidelines are good as they are kind of like lines on a road which help keep you in the proper lane and help prevent accidents.
 >On the other hand, I think people can get rather dogmatic about the guidelines and restrictions, forgetting that they aren’t Absolutes, and that they also in many ways are dependent on other materials that they are formulated with. In other words, some materials that may have a higher incidence of reactivity may be counterbalanced by are the materials used in formulation.
 >Let’s also not forget to things like hot chilies, pepper, etc. can be used in incredibly high doses in culinary preparations that may be too hard for some, then just fine for others. Going back to what I’m saying about guidelines being guidelines and not getting dogmatic about the guidelines.
 >One other issue I take with us is that different markets use different standards, with the EU standards being on the verge of ridiculous, especially for small companies that are not in the EU and are trying to sell products in the EU.
 >One last note… The guidelines seem to work when companies have huge legal departments and expensive equipment to test materials, not to mention programs and algorithms which help to calculate accurately all of the restricted materials that smaller companies just don’t have the access to.
 >Leading back to dogmatic following of the guidelines.
 >They aren’t laws ... but you wouldn’t know that talking to some folks
 >**Heather Mayberry Melton**
 >as far as correct calculation ans such I can pay perfumers apprentice for example $100 to compound MY formula and provide IFRA docs ans $50 of that goes back towards the compounding of my first batch
 >**JK Delapp** 
 The challenge still arises on the front end of formulating per the guidelines. Testing each batch of materials. Balancing the internal components of each material to be within guidelines, etc.
