Title
Why choose natural over synthetic?

Question
"Why synthetic perfumes are unhealthy and why natural perfumes are healthy?"

Answer
You know, the answer to that question is a little more complicated than you think. first, not all synthetics are bad and not all naturals are good. what makes one thing a medicine and another a poison depends on the dose. there's a famous saying in toxicology, "The does make the poison." anything excessive can be harmful, even the air you breathe and the water you drink.

Every day we take in and take out many chemical compounds. and some chemicals take a longer time to get rid of from your body. now, synthetics are produced by isolating a specific compound from materials, so that we can use that specific compound deliberately at an intended concentration and combination.

The problem is that we haven't figured out what chain reactions every chemical compounds have in every combination and what negative effect will occur when someone is exposed to a certain set of chemicals over a long period. when some chemicals accumulate in organs and become excessive, that often leads to health problems. in traditional Chinese medicine, disease, and pain occur when something in your body is out of balance. therapy is done to attain balanced status.

On the other hand, natural materials most of the time innately have certain properties in them to not become excessively toxic, making them more balanced in nature. although they have certain directions of properties.

For those reasons, synthetic perfumes can smell great but are often time not good for your health.
